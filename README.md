# Bengaluru House Price Prediction

## Introduction
This project is about predicting the house prices in Bengaluru, India based on the location, total area, number of rooms and baths and some other features provided in the dataset. We will try different models to get the best prediction score.

## About the data
The [Bengaluru house price data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data) is made available by [AmitabhaChakraborty](https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy). The data set contains 9 columns which are area_type, availability, location, size, society, total_sqft, bath, balcony and price.

 - python 3.0 or above.
 - jupyter notebook or jupyter lab should be installed
 - pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn libraries should also be installed

## Steps involved
- Data exploration using pandas and matplotlib.
- Handling missing values and data manipulation.
